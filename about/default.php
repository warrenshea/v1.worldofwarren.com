          <h2>About Me</h2><br>
          <div class="custom-content">
            I was born in the early 80s and have lived in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) most of my life - Richmond Hill, a few years in Waterloo (ON), and currently in the Annex in downtown Toronto.<br><br>
            I've got a great number of hobbies and passions - taking the role of designer, developer, writer, artist, gamer, blogger, collector, photographer. I'm not an expert at any one thing but enjoy a number of things.<br><br>
            I'm currently employed as a manager of a development team at one of the top five canadian financial institutions. Prior to that, I've spent my career and much of my free time doing front-end web development.<br><br>
            I believe that the purpose of life is to learn and share your learnings - whether it be a skill in development, cooking, basketball, being a foodie, or video games. Everyone is learning and growing throughout their entire life and I believe anything worth doing is in the pursuit of knowledge.<br><br>
            My goal in life is to be happy - to know that I've lived my life as well as I could have lived it, doing what I want.<br><br><br>
